# Logistic Regression - Binary Classification

##  Tools & Libraries Used

A binary classification model is implememted using Logistic Regression to predict breast cancer diagnoses (Malignant or Benign) using the Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset. 
The workflow includes loading and cleaning the data, encoding the target variable, and visualizing feature correlations. 
The dataset is split into training and test sets and applied standardization to normalize the features.
A logistic regression model is trained, and its performance is evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, confusion matrix,
and ROC-AUC score. Additionally, classification threshold is adjusted to observe its impact on recall and precision. 
The sigmoid activation function is explained and visualized, highlighting its role in mapping predictions to probabilities for binary classification tasks.
